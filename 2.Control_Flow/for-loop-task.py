my_fruits = ("banana", "apple", "jackfruit", "grapes")

for fruit in my_fruits:
  print(fruit)

# Critique & lesson learned:
# () - creates a tuple which is immutale data type or structure
# [] - creates a list which is a mutable data type or structure
# Should have used [] if i wanted to add remove or change the order of the fruits in my_fruits
